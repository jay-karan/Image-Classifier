### Problem Statement

A Primitive AI Application as an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Similar to a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. Training the classifier, then exporting it for using it in the application. 

### Data

102 category dataset, consisting of 102 flower categories. The flowers chosen to be flower commonly occuring in the United Kingdom. The dataset is found at: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
